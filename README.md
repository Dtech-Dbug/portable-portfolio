### Quick Intro üëã

My name is Dwaipayan Chakraborty, and more often than not, I go by ‚ÄòDC‚Äô. 
I celebrate open source and collaboration.
I love building products, making existing products better, simplifying and making people‚Äôs lives easier. 

I have over 3YOE working across Digital Retail (ASE), PropTech (Founding SWE), SaaS (FSE) - developing and delivering complex e2e solutions for the web, mostly JS (not limited to) across the stack. I am ‚Äòsorta‚Äô familiar with solving real world problems using the webTech (cz tbh tech is a perpetual journey). Ilike clean code, and truly admire readability, maintainability over fancyness.

Coming from PBC and Startups, I am familiar with - 
- the ‚Äòproduct‚Äô way of engineering
- building products 0-1
- working on high ownership projects
- communicate w stakeholders to understand requirements, prioritize/delegate tasks to meet deadlines, define problem statements
- craft PRDs and User Stories to lead to clarity of purpose for each feature developed
- documenting softwares, APIs for internal (cross function) teams and clients
- adapt to the fast paced startup dynamics 

I feel - My PM side of skills/experience can be an asset for engineering roles (esp for early stage products), and conversely my engineering knowledge is an asset for APM/PM roles.

I have a great inclination towards products, processes and people. (Oh and music and memes)
I am happy to chat, in case you have an opportunity, questions or simply music/meme sharing. 
You will find my Linkedin at the bottom of this DOC, and if you make it that far - dont forget to add me and say ‚ÄòHi‚Äô üòÅ




This doc is a collation of some of the projects I have worked on. It contains links to demos, description of the projects and the tools used.

### 1. KNOWApp

Description - KNOW is super app, powering frontline workers. It is a SaaS platform that digitizes all the tedious paperworks needed in Restaurants, Retail and Last Mile Company. 
I was part of their dashboard, web client and backend team, working with tools like react/react native/ node/express/firebase. 
The above link is a screen record of the react native app built (the project is live, but you can‚Äôt view it without proper creds, so I pasted the rec). 
We have build many modules/features like - LMS, Tasks/Issues/ Instagram Like Story feature. The above snippet is just a demo of all those.

***Tools used - React, React Native, Node/Hapi, Firebase RTDB, Psql***

### 2. MemeTem - Open Source

MemeTem was designed to be the one stop solution for everything memes. Starting with the MVP version of just having meme templates. [Eventually we plan to have, a collection of cooked memes and also editing templates]

MemeTem is my personal open source project. I am the author and a maintainer of this project as well. I listed it on HacktoberFest‚Äô24 as a maintainer/author.

***Tools used - web scraping, react, tailwind and framer.***

### 4. Modular/ReUsable Form Component with internal styles and client side validation 

[Link to the github gist /  code sample](https://gist.github.com/Dtech-Dbug/008de2a9d11e09fd9da494678d981415)

This was back when I was working as a founding engineer for a propTech company. The wireframes had too many screens with form like patterns. I used modularity and polymorphism to create a re-usbale form component (with internal styling and FE validation), to avoid repeating lines of code. 
This GIST has the reusable component and also an example usage. I am very proud of this code i have written. As it is following DRY principle, we can change at one place and the change will reflect to every other place that component is being used. 

***Tools/Ideas used - modularity, re-usability, Svelte***

### 5. Outreach - Open Source Collaboration
Outreach was my first open source collaboration with a friend I met online. It was a fun side project built for his college final year degree - a social media for the devs. We used a lot of full stack concepts, including auth, protected routes, posts, comments, feed, profile etc. 

[Find the codebase here ü§ì](https://github.com/Dtech-Dbug/Outreach)

***Tools used - React, Node, Express, JWT, MongoDB***

### 6. Covigency - healthCare app (volunteered project) 
It was a volunteered project I took up during the lockdown era, where I led the development efforts to get the MVP, by collaborating with designers and other fellow developers remotely. The idea of this initiative was to make covid-case accessible with a click, with resources for vax, health care tips etc. 
It is now no longer in use, and I am glad rightfully so cause covid fear is finally over, for the good. 
Tools used - React, CSS, Git

### 6. Clone of clubhouse UI
Just a fun light hearted effort of cloning clubhouse, using just React and pure CSS
