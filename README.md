### Quick Intro üëã

My name is Dwaipayan Chakraborty, and more often than not, I go by ‚ÄòDC‚Äô. 
I celebrate open source and collaboration.
I love building products, improving existing products, simplifying, and making people‚Äôs lives easier. 

I have over 3YOE working across Digital Retail (ASE), PropTech (Founding SWE), SaaS (FSE) - developing and delivering complex e2e solutions for the web, mostly JS (not limited to) across the stack. I am ‚Äòsorta‚Äô familiar with solving real-world problems using the webTech (cz tbh tech is a perpetual journey). I like clean code and truly admire readability, maintainability over fanciness.

Coming from PBC and Startups, I am familiar with - 
- the ‚Äòproduct‚Äô way of engineering, and the product/client first mindset
- ability to gain a deep understanding of a product, and the context in which it‚Äôs being used
- customer obsession
- building products 0-1
- working on high-ownership projects
- cross-functional collaborations
- Communicate with stakeholders to understand requirements, prioritize/delegate tasks to meet deadlines, and define problem statements
- craft PRDs and User Stories to lead to clarity of purpose for each feature developed
- documenting software, APIs for internal (cross-functional) teams and clients
- leading execution campaigns
- handling client queries, troubleshooting client issues with maximum efficiency
- adapting to the fast-paced startup dynamics 

I feel - My PM side of skills/experience can be an asset for engineering roles (esp for early stage products), and conversely, my engineering knowledge is an asset for APM/PM roles.

Over the years, I have realised my strengths not just lie in coding or the what and how of building a software, but I am also equally interested to learn the ‚Äòwhy‚Äô behind a feature the impact anticipated, the problem being solved to gain a deeper understanding of why we are doing certain things and how it corresponds to product and customer success. 

I also find a great sense of fulfilment in helping clients navigate a challenge and seeing them succeed. I like using my technical context and ability to gain deep product understanding to help encourage clients to make better decisions. The feeling of guiding someone to the right direction, aligning with their needs and requirements, especially when they‚Äôre feeling lost or confused, is ecstatic.

With that said, I am open to exploring roles that allow me to blend my Tech x Product x Client Orientation skills. I will be glad to hear about opportunities that are primarily client or product-facing. I would love to leverage my skills, keep learning in order to excel in these. Provide terrific support and build long-term relationships along the way.

I have a great inclination towards products, processes, and people. (Oh, and music and memes)
I am happy to chat, in case you have an opportunity, questions, or simply music/meme sharing. 
You will find my Linkedin at the bottom of this DOC, and if you make it that far, don't forget to add me and say ‚ÄòHi‚Äô üòÅ

### 1. KNOWApp

Description - KNOW is super app, powering frontline workers. It is a SaaS platform that digitizes all the tedious paperworks needed in Restaurants, Retail and Last Mile Company. 
I was part of their dashboard, web client and backend team, working with tools like react/react native/ node/express/firebase. 
The above link is a screen record of the react native app built (the project is live, but you can‚Äôt view it without proper creds, so I pasted the rec). 
We have build many modules/features like - LMS, Tasks/Issues/ Instagram Like Story feature. The above snippet is just a demo of all those. 
Learn more about KNOW here - https://www.getknowapp.com/ 

***Tools used - React, React Native, Node/Hapi, Firebase RTDB, Psql***

### 2. MemeTem - Open Source

MemeTem was designed to be the one-stop solution for everything memes. Starting with the MVP version of just having meme templates. [Eventually, we plan to have a collection of cooked memes, right now it supports viewing collection, searching templates by name, and also edit memes donwload templates and edits]

MemeTem is my open-source project. I am the author and a maintainer of this project as well. I listed it on HacktoberFest‚Äô24 as a maintainer/author.

***Skills/tools used - web scraping, React, Tailwind, and Framer.***

The fun part is - the most challenging part about this project isn‚Äôt the technical aspect. It was the management, comms, and collab part. With over 8 people contributing from diff states, cities, and at different times, with no daily standups ‚Äì  the challenge was managing issues, managing PR‚Äôs, checking for duplicates, code reviews, and refactoring messy code. But despite all these challenges, this was one of my favorite and most fulfilling experiences, something that I will keep coming back to.

### 3. RagBot - Google Notebook LLM clone - 
Building a RAG system can be a very humbling experience for almost any developers, because of all the nuances that come with it - Data Ingestion, Cleaning, Embeddings, Storing vectors, Query Retrieval, and integrating LLMs. 
With rigorous research, I thankfully stumbled across PineCone SDK - a game-changing product. That supports a lot of those things out of the box. 
Which also made me realise, one of the early challenges for building anything is considering the trade-offs, deeply evaluating the requirements, and researching to come up with the most optimal, lean way to at least have the POC out. 

***tools used - React, TailwindCSS, Node/Express, PCA SDK***

This project is also open source, please refer to the README.md for detailed steps to set up and regarding the principles followed.

### 4. Modular/ReUsable Form Component with internal styles and client side validation 

[Link to the github gist /  code sample](https://gist.github.com/Dtech-Dbug/008de2a9d11e09fd9da494678d981415)

This was back when I was working as a founding engineer for a propTech company. The wireframes had too many screens with form like patterns. I used modularity and polymorphism to create a re-usbale form component (with internal styling and FE validation), to avoid repeating lines of code. 
This GIST has the reusable component and also an example usage. I am very proud of this code i have written. As it is following DRY principle, we can change at one place and the change will reflect to every other place that component is being used. 

***Tools/Ideas used - modularity, re-usability, Svelte***

### 5. Outreach - Open Source Collaboration
Outreach was my first open source collaboration with a friend I met online. It was a fun side project built for his college final year degree - a social media for the devs. We used a lot of full stack concepts, including auth, protected routes, database ops to read/write profile, post, comments etc. 

[Find the codebase here ü§ì](https://github.com/Dtech-Dbug/Outreach)

***Tools used - React, Node, Express, JWT, MongoDB***

### 6. Covigency - healthCare app (volunteered project) 
It was a volunteered project I took up during the lockdown era, where I led the development efforts to get the MVP, by collaborating with designers and other fellow developers remotely. The idea of this initiative was to make covid-case accessible with a click, with resources for vax, health care tips etc. 
It is now no longer in use, and I am glad rightfully so cause covid fear is finally over, for the good. 
Tools used - React, CSS, Git

### 6. Clone of clubhouse UI
Just a fun light hearted effort of cloning clubhouse, using just React and pure CSS
